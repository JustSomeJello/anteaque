**Anteaque** is a _Minecraft_ mod that follows one premise: any students in the _Class of 2029 GAME program_ at _Brock Univerisity_ are allowed to contribute content, such as code, assets, and anything else to this mod*! This project aims to be a way for us to practice our skills in a supportive environment that supports teamwork and collaboration to make something special and memorable!\
`* (content will be reviewed and must follow the rules below in order to be valid for addition.)`

# Rules for Content Submission
**Please follow these rules! Failure to do so may lead to your merge request being denied, and on more serious offenses a blacklist from this repo!**
1. **NO NSFW CONTENT**. Emphasis on nudity, sexual topics, fetishes, and anything else that falls under NSFW.
2. Do not add any backdoors / cheats made to benefit you / others.
3. Keep your content balanced for the setting of the pack. Don't add anything that could possibly be meta-defining without consultation first!
4. Make sure none of your content violates any copyright!
5. Avoid changes that might cause issues for other mods.
6. Do not add content that supplements parts of gameplay (quote unquote "quality of life" mods).
<br/>
If you are unsure about something that may violate the rules, send me a DM and I'll clear it up for you!

# Process For Submitting Content
Content submission, while straightforward in practice, requires a couple of steps, namely to make sure the mod has some form of cohesion and doesn't devolve into a "kitchen sink"\
<sub>(a modpack which is full of random mods, most of which unmodified, leaving the modpack a mess in terms of direction and content).<sub/>

### 1. Submitting An Idea
**This is arguably the most important step!!!** It is important that you get your idea approved before working on your content. Me, Laksh, Adian, and Nemona will be in charge of approving ideas. Letting us know of your idea / plans for adding content beforehand gives us a good idea on what content is going to be added to the mod down the line. It also allows us to give you pointers and advice for your ideas. _It's also a good idea to try and assemble a group of people if possible!_\
After your idea gets approved by us, we'll pitch it in the Anteaque thread in the Discord server to see how the public feels about your idea.

### 2. Development
After your mod idea gets approved, we'll open a new branch for your group to work on your mod. From there, your group is free to work on your branch. DM me if you want to add group members who have access to your branch!

### 3. Content Submission
After you have your stuff made and in proper format, submit a pull request to this repo. From there, we'll put it into an experimental branch for playtesting, which we'll push into the main branch if everything seems good!
